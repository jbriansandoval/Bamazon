10: MySQL Homework

For this assignment we used Mysql to create a CLI app.  This app is similar to an online store that sells and manages inventory.  When started, you will have a menu to select which items you wish to purchase.  Simply enter the line number or product ID, located in the first column into the app.  Next time how many items you wish to purchase.  Either your order will be placed or you will be informed of the inventory storage.  Finally you will have the option to continue shopping or exit the app. 

To open the app simply type "node bamazonCustomer.js" in Git Bash/Terminal

See Demo folder for step by step photos.
